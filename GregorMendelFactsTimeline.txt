Johann Mendel

1840: Attends the University of Olmutz in the Czech Republic.

1853: upon completing his studies at the University of Vienna, Mendel returned to the monastery in Brno and was given a teaching position at a secondary school, where he would stay for more than a decade.

1854: Mendel began research into the transmission of hereditary traits in plant hybrids

1863-1866: conducted tests that became known as Mendels Law of Heredity. Mendel's first experiments described the heredity pattern of single characters. Mendel explained these results by reasoning that each plant had two units of inheritance for any given trait. Mendel’s second set of experiments involved measuring the heredity patterns of two characters at a time.

1883: Mendels law of segregation discovered. Mendel’s work helped lay the foundation for modern genetics, and his discoveries and conclusions have largely stood the test of time.

1884: January 6th (aged 61) - Died in Brünn, Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic)
