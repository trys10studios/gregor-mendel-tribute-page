            <b>1853: </b> upon completing his studies at the University of Vienna, Mendel returned to the monastery in
            Brno and
            was given a teaching position at a secondary school, where he would stay for more than a decade.

            <b>1854: </b> Mendel began research into the transmission of hereditary traits in plant hybrids, most
            notably, pea
            pods**.

        <li id="Fact5">
            <b>1863-1866: </b>conducted tests that became known as Mendels Law of Heredity. Mendel's first experiments
            described the heredity pattern of single characters. Mendel explained these results by reasoning that each
            plant had two units of inheritance for any given trait. Mendel’s second set of experiments involved
            measuring the heredity patterns of two characters at a time.
        </li>
        <li id="Fact6">
            <b>1883: </b>Mendels law of segregation discovered. Mendel’s work helped lay the foundation for modern
            genetics,
            and his discoveries and conclusions have largely stood the test of time.

        <aside>**The peapods' wrinkles were in fact due to a mutation, something that which Mendel could not have been
            aware, DNA had yet to be discovered.
            Nonetheless, this did not affect the results of his research.</aside><a
